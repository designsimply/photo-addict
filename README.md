Photo Addict is a mouthwatering blend of flexbox with handpicked morsels of color and spiced with random images. It is an experimental flexbox layout theme made by Sheri Bigelow for WordPress with love. It uses some advanced CSS3 that may not work in older browsers, and it was designed with modern browsers in mind as part of an adventure in theming without restraint.
